# notes
hello
I decided that I don't want to depend on companies  like microsoft for note-taking, so I decided to make my own with most of the features that they offer some include (If it  has a ✅ then it is added)
| autosave ✅
| sub-note ✅
| multiple device support (notes acros multiple devices)
| support photos
| mobile version
